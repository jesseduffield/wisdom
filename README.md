Stuff I wish I knew at the start

This repo is mine and mine alone. The only reason it's public is because I'm too stingy to pay for github premium (which is required for private Wikis)! Nonetheless if you have feedback let me know

The actual content is under the 'Wiki' tab.

I will likely re-post some of the entries here in my [blog](https://jesseduffield.com/) but my blog has a broader scope than just tech, and is a place where I try to explore ideas I haven't fully thought through. This repo will be for things I'm pretty sure I'm right about and that would be helpful to my younger self.
